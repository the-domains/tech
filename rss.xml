            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ethereum founder: Now we can scale the system</h1><p>Founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin claims he has found the ultimate solution to the problem of scalability haunting cryptocurrency networks. That will be made possible with lightning networks and sharding. The reason why scalability is such an important issue is that in a regular blockchain, say, the bitcoin blockchain, each computer has to validate every transaction, said Buterin during a recent meeting with the Coinbase team.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f0f8c84b5b1f264401c19e3ec60da270f01d5359.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Lower CO2 Emissions Could Save the US Billions</h1><p>Climate change is about money. The expenses associated with adapting to, saving people from, and mitigating the effects of climate change drove much of the discussion during last year's big Paris negotiations. And those costs are arguably at the root of climate denial-or at least provide excuse enough for many to throw their hands up at the problem.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5c259ca4bf36b9e9e95258853bf89ee6cf737c62.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Gravitational waves have been detected for the first time</h1><p>TWO black holes circle one another. Both are about 100km across. One contains 36 times as much mass as the sun; the other, 29. They are locked in an orbital dance, a kilometre or so apart, that is accelerating rapidly to within a whisker of the speed of light.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e265cb24e8adabfa9a8c29495ad6ed043800d748.jpg"></article>]]></description>
