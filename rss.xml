            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Gravitational waves have been detected for the first time</h1><p>TWO black holes circle one another. Both are about 100km across. One contains 36 times as much mass as the sun; the other, 29. They are locked in an orbital dance, a kilometre or so apart, that is accelerating rapidly to within a whisker of the speed of light.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e265cb24e8adabfa9a8c29495ad6ed043800d748.jpg"></article>]]></description>
