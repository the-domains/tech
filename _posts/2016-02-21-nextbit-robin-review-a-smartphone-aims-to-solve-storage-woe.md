description: "Nextbit is trying to make it so you never run out of storage on your smartphone. Robin, the first smartphone from startup Nextbit, is a fine phone and a good-looking handset. But just making a (generally) nice phone wasn't the aim of Robin's creators, who previously worked on Android at Google and design and user experience at HTC."
