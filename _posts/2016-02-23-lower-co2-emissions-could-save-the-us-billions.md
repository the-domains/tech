description: "Climate change is about money. The expenses associated with adapting to, saving people from, and mitigating the effects of climate change drove much of the discussion during last year's big Paris negotiations. And those costs are arguably at the root of climate denial-or at least provide excuse enough for many to throw their hands up at the problem."
